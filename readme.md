# Javascript Debugging

1. During the lesson, "index.html" referenced "scripts/app.js".  We used "scripts/app.js" to demonstrate various debugging tools and practices.

2. During this exercise, you will switch "index.html" to use "scripts/debug.js".  Use your newly learned tools to identify, and correct, the issues with this code.  Your goal is to log each function to the console, in order.

Like this:
```
[Log] Starting (debug.js, line 63)
[Log] inside function1 (debug.js, line 55)
[Log] inside function2 (debug.js, line 50)
[Log] inside function3 (debug.js, line 38)
[Log] inside function4 (debug.js, line 42)
[Log] inside function5 (debug.js, line 24)
[Log] inside function6 (debug.js, line 29)
[Log] inside function7 (debug.js, line 19)
[Log] inside function8 (debug.js, line 10)
[Log] inside function9 (debug.js, line 4)
[Log] The end (debug.js, line 5)
```
